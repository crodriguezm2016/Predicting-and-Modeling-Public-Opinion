# Predicting and Modeling Public Opinion

This is an R markdown file of my senior project. This project used regression techniques and parameter estimation in order to fully build out a mathematical model of 3 Differential Equations that would predict and model public opinion polling. Training and Testing Data was from the Gallop Polling Organizaiton.
